<p align="justify"> Here we present some of the exploratory graph we made for our analysis. </p>



<p align="justify">We produce a bar plot of the number of restaurant we have by type of cuisine. It allow us to see that clearly there is 4 major categories. </p>

<p align="justify"> We make a boxplot of number of inspection by cuisine types. We can see that they all are in the same range of numbers of control. The median are different for certain type of cuisines but in a general way every body get control the same number of time. </p>

<p align="justify">We plot the numbers of critical ratio in function of the type of cuisine. It allow us to find out that the only pattern/correlation we can find is that when a restaurant is tested a lot of time he probably will have an average critical ratio, and that the extreme value for critical ratio are on restaurant that did not get controlled a lot. </p>

<p align="justify"> We now plot the price proportion for each type of cuisine. Itâ€™s interesting to see that for the 4 main categories, we have french cuisine that tend to be more expensive, Asian that is more cheap and the two other in the middle. This fit quite well which the cliche idea of what a type of cuisine is like.</p>

</figure>

<p align="justify"> We now try to see if there is any correlation between the critical ratio and the price categories of a restaurant. Once again there is not any relationship and we clearly see that on the graph :</p>
